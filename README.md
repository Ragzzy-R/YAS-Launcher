# YAS-Launcher (Yet Another Simple Launcher)
An opensource Launcher for Android

this is an opensource Launcher made by me as an hobby project. The project is given under GPL v3. This is mostly for educational purposes and if you like, you can use it as your launcher. The idea is to write a simple launcher without all the bells and whistles of the launchers out there in playstore. If you would like to contribute please do a pull request.
